### R Markdown
The R Markdown syntax is derived from [Markdown Extended](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/sublime-markdown-extended). LaTeX syntax is supported in R Markdown. For example

```
- $a$ and $b$ are variables such that
$$ 
a^2 + b^2 = 1
$$
```

Note: The dollor sign `$` is treated as a special char, to display the original dollor sign `$`, please type `\$`.
