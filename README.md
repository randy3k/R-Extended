R Extended for Sublime Text 2/3
------------
This package contains more comprehensive indentation and syntax for the R language.

It support Roxygen and R Markdown syntaxes. 
To have the best result of R Markdown syntax highlighting,
you have to install Jon Schlinkert's [Markdown Extended](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/sublime-markdown-extended).

* Mathjax support for R Markdown will be the next item in the TODO list.
